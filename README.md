Pandas Challenge Analyzing Gaming Data

First, I opened Jupyter Notebook from git bash, imported dependencies (pandas and numpy), and read in the .csv file.

Then I calculated the following:
* total number of players
* number of unique items
* average purchase price
* total number of purchases
* total revenue
* percentage and count of male, female, and other/non-disclosed players
