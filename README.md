Pandas Challenge Analyzing Gaming Data

First, I opened Jupyter Notebook from git bash, imported dependencies (pandas and numpy), and read in the .csv file.

Second, I calculated the following:
* total number of players
* number of unique items
* average purchase price
* total number of purchases
* total revenue

Third, I used .groupby() and 'bins' to perform calculations on certain groups, such as:
* percentage and count of different genders and ages
* purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and average purchase total per person by gender and age groups
* top spenders by screen name
